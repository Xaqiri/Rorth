: writeln ( a -- ) . print ;
: sq ( a -- a*a ) dup * ;

\ word syntax can be used to define constants 
: x 10 ;
: y 5 ;

x sq writeln 
y writeln

\ since words and variables aren't defined the same in the compiler, attempting to
\ assign a new value causes a variable not found error
( 1 x := )
\ but they can be manipulated and assigned to a new variable as expected
x y + z :=
z sq writeln
